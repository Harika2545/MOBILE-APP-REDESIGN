### **Description

### **Task 3: Mobile App-Redesign**

# **Swiggy Mobile App Redesign — Order Tracking Experience**

##  **Overview**

This redesign focuses on simplifying and enhancing the user experience during **food order tracking** on Swiggy.
The goal is to make the process **clearer, more visual, and emotionally engaging**, while maintaining the brand’s clean orange aesthetic.

The prototype consists of **three key screens**:

1. Order Summary
2. Live Order Tracking
3. Delivery Completed


##  **1. Order Summary Screen**

### **Purpose:**

To give users a clear summary of their order before they start tracking it.

### **Key UI Elements:**

* **Title:** “Your Order Summary” — bold, black text ensures immediate clarity.
* **Restaurant Card:** Displays restaurant logo, name, and rating.

  * Small orange Swiggy icon for brand consistency.
  * “Estimated Delivery: 25 mins” highlights time upfront.
* **Order Details:** Itemized list (e.g., “Paneer Butter Masala x2”, “Naan x1”) with right-aligned prices.
* **Total Amount:** Clean and bold (“₹450”) — placed at the bottom for easy visibility.
* **Primary CTA Button:**

  * “Track My Order” in white text on an orange background (#FC8019).
  * Rounded corners and subtle drop shadow — stands out as the main interactive element.

### **UX Purpose:**

✔ Clear overview before tracking begins
✔ Direct call to action with a single, focused button

## **2. Live Order Tracking Screen**

### **Purpose:**

To provide users with **real-time visibility** of their order’s journey and keep them reassured during the wait.

### **Top Section:**

* **Header:** “Order on the Way 🚴‍♂️” — uses an icon for visual appeal.
* **Delivery Info:** “Your food is being delivered by Arjun” — adds a personal touch.
* **ETA Badge:** “25 mins” — bright orange capsule, highly visible against the light background.

### **Middle Section (Map Area):**

* **Interactive Map:** Simplified route visualization.
* **Animated Delivery Partner Icon:** A scooter moving along the orange dotted path, representing live movement.
* **Destination Marker:** Bright orange pin showing where the order is headed.

### **Bottom Section (Status Card):**

* **Progress Timeline:**

  * Steps: “Order Confirmed → Being Prepared → Picked Up → Out for Delivery → Delivered”.
  * Completed stages shown in **orange**, upcoming ones in **gray**.
  * Helps users quickly understand progress at a glance.
* **Quick Contact Bar:**

  * Circular icons for **Call**, **Chat**, and **Help**.
  * Each icon has a simple, minimal label below.
  * Easy one-tap access for user assistance.

### **UX Purpose:**

✔ Reduces anxiety with clear, visual progress indicators
✔ Allows quick access to support
✔ Uses color psychology (orange = activity + optimism)


##  **3.Delivery Completed Screen**

### **Purpose:**

To conclude the order experience positively and encourage further engagement.

### **Visuals:**

* Illustration of a delivery person holding food — friendly and celebratory.
* Orange circle background keeps branding consistent.

### **Text:**

* **Primary Message:** “Your food has arrived! 🍔” — bold and joyful.
* **Subtext:** “We hope you enjoy your meal.” — warm and polite tone.

### **Action Buttons:**

1. **Rate Your Delivery Partner:**

   * Outline style (orange border, white fill).
   * Encourages user feedback immediately.
2. **Reorder This Meal:**

   * Filled orange button.
   * Promotes repeat orders (business-friendly feature).

### **UX Purpose:**

✔ Positive emotional closure
✔ Promotes engagement (rating + reordering)
✔ Keeps user in the Swiggy ecosystem
